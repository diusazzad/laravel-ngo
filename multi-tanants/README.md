a multi-tenant application. A multi-tenant application is a single application that serves multiple tenants, each of which has its own isolated data and configuration. In this case, the tenants are the NGO organizations that the superadmin can assign.

The superadmin can assign each NGO organization its own admin, employees, and customers. Each tenant has its own isolated data, so the data of one tenant cannot be accessed by another tenant.

Multi-tenant applications are often used in SaaS (Software as a Service) applications, where a single application is used by many different customers.

Here is an example of how a multi-tenant application might work in an NGO management system:

The superadmin creates a new NGO organization and assigns it an admin username and password.
The admin of the NGO organization logs in and creates employee and customer accounts.
Employees and customers of the NGO organization can log in and access the features of the system that are relevant to them.
The superadmin can also manage the permissions of each tenant. For example, the superadmin could grant the admin of an NGO organization the ability to create new employee and customer accounts, but not the ability to delete existing accounts.

Multi-tenant applications can be complex to develop, but they offer a number of benefits, including:

Reduced costs: A single application can be used by many different tenants, which can reduce the cost of development and maintenance.
Increased scalability: A multi-tenant application can be easily scaled to accommodate more tenants.
Improved security: Each tenant has its own isolated data, which can improve security and privacy.
If you are developing an NGO management system, you may want to consider using a multi-tenant architecture. This will allow you to build a single application that can be used by many different NGO organizations.
